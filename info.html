    <h1 id="affected">We are all Affected.</h1>
    <p>As humanity has burned fossil fuels and modified the environment around us, we’ve created an unprecedented spike in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. These GHGs – called “greenhouse gases” because they trap the sun’s warmth like a greenhouse does – have gradually warmed our atmosphere and heated up our oceans. Unfortunately, the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere is still increasing (and will do so until we get to net-zero emissions), so our global temperature keeps growing along with it.</p>

    <p>Climate change represents the consequences resulting from a warmer atmosphere and oceans. Among other things, extreme weather (e.g., storms and heat waves) becomes more frequent and intense; there are deeper and longer-lasting droughts; wildfires spread faster and wider; glaciers and sea ice gradually melt; oceans rise; some areas have more intense cold snaps; and both precipitation patterns and seasons in general change. These changes transform nature itself: habitats get damaged or destroyed, such as through wildfire or flooded coastlines; animals and plants migrate, shrink in population, or go extinct; invasive species inhabit new territory; and rivers run dry. Ultimately, changing climates and environments impact humanity and everything we’ve built, leaving us with a perilous future. Some examples include damaged infrastructure from storms and wildfires; reduced crop yields from drought and invasive pests; inundated coastal areas due to rising oceans; public health stresses from extreme heat and more disease; and the things above contributing to unstable governments or large-scale migration.</p>

    <p>We face a very serious future, but we can still make a difference. The two key components of climate action are mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation is the process of slowing and even reducing climate change: it involves things like reducing emissions and restoring habitats that can absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Adaptation involves preparing for the climate change that’s heading our way, including through disaster readiness, better water management, reinforcing the electric grid, and even proactively relocating people away from areas that may become uninhabitable (such as soon-to-be-flooded coastlines). We absolutely must work together, both within and between communities, using mitigation and adaptation to build a secure future.</p>

    <h1 id="emission">Mission to stop Emissions</h1>

    <p>Natural gas is a versatile fuel, capable of powering utilities, homes and transportation. It also emits significantly fewer pollutants than coal power generation, including NOx, SOx, particulates, mercury, and up to 60 percent fewer GHGs. As confirmed by the International Energy Agency, methane emissions do not negate the substantial climate change benefits of natural gas versus coal, but mitigating emissions can further enhance those benefits. This is a key component of ExxonMobil’s approach to developing future energy technology. The company continues to implement cost-effective methods to reduce methane and other hydrocarbon emissions in our operations.</p>

    <p>All of the world’s energy sources will be needed to meet rising demand to 2040, but there will be a marked shift toward cleaner fuels, particularly natural gas. Not only are natural gas resources geographically and geologically diverse, abundant, reliable and versatile in use (power generation; residential, commercial, industrial heating and cooking; and even transportation), but also natural gas emits significantly fewer pollutants than coal power generation, including NOx, SOx, particulates, mercury, and up to 60 percent fewer GHGs.</p>

    <p id = "space"> Oil and natural gas technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have unlocked vast unconventional resources. These supplies have dramatically altered the energy landscape over the past decade, particularly in North America. Natural gas usage is projected to continue to expand rapidly. We expect about 40 percent of the projected growth in global energy demand from 2016 to 2040 will be met by natural gas.</p>
